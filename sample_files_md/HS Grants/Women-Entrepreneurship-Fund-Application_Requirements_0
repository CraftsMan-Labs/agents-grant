2. ABOUT THE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP FUND

Overview:

The Government of Canada is committed to advancing gender equality, women’s economic empowerment, and supporting women entrepreneurs through the new Women Entrepreneurship Strategy (the Strategy), announced in Budget 2018. As part of the Strategy, the Government has made funding available to women-owned and/or women-led businesses to support them in their growth and to pursue market opportunities abroad.

The full and equal participation of women in the economy is essential to Canada’s competitiveness. Current female entrepreneurs face unique barriers as they move along the business cycle. As a result, women own fewer than 16% of businesses and are underrepresented in the economy.

By addressing women’s economic empowerment through initiatives such as the Women Entrepreneurship Strategy, Canada will have the potential to add $150 billion in incremental GDP by 2026 and reach its goal of doubling the number of majority women-owned businesses by 2025.

Entrepreneurship Fund Objectives:

The Entrepreneurship Fund is a $20 million investment which aims to assist women entrepreneurs to grow their existing businesses and enable them to pursue opportunities in

# APPENDIX B – PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRIES UNDER THE SIX ECONOMIC STRATEGY TABLES

In Budget 2017, the Government of Canada announced a new vision for Canada's economy as a global leader in innovation, anchored by the Innovation and Skills Plan. In this plan, the creation of the six Economic Strategy tables will support innovation in advanced manufacturing, agri-food, clean technology, digital industries, health/bio-sciences, and resources of the future.

The Economic Strategy Tables are a new model for industry-government collaboration, focused on turning Canadian economic strengths into global advantages. The Tables are chaired by industry leaders and will set ambitious growth targets, identify sector-specific challenges and "bottlenecks", and lay out an actionable roadmap to achieve their goals.

Advanced manufacturing is defined by the development and adoption of innovative technologies to create new products, enhance processes and establish more efficient and cost-effective ways of working.

Agri-Food, a complex and interdependent sector, includes agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and food and beverage processing.

Health/Bio-sciences encompasses a wide range of companies, from the developers and manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and biomedical innovations, to producers of digital health solutions and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, 3D printing, robotics and nanotechnologies.

Clean Technology refers to any process, product or service that reduces environmental impacts in order to better control costs, meet new regulatory requirements, improve global competitiveness and reduce impacts on climate, water, land and air.

Digital Industries includes a combination of information and communication technology (ICT), digital and interactive media, and content industries as well as manufacturers and service companies that use creativity, talent and digital skills to capture, transmit and display data and information electronically in ever-evolving innovative ways. While it does not capture the full breadth of the digital industries including parts of the creative industries, the best framework currently available to benchmark growth is the ICT sector.

Resources of the Future refers to transitioning from the old resource economy into a new resource economy. It’s where innovation drives economic and environmental competitiveness in the energy, mining and forest sectors, and which leverages Canada’s natural resources advantage to transition to a low-carbon economy.
