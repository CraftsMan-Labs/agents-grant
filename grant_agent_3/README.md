A simple UI to generate queries outbound SQL while having a convo


So how critical feature feature is simple now stage one let us have an API and API has something that needs a unique identifier to target in the unique user so basically sign up obviously. After they come to see a chat UI and the right side there will be what will be a form so the left will be the right form and the form has questions and ideas in the chat will be answering each question and it's asking and every question is asked right and fill up the form and remember the form is editable .

Remember when it's conversing it has to contact the API. now what happens when just asking each question right now we come to question number two you should add a new met up prompt to the conversation history and send that back to the API to new content and every time it answers the question right you have to reply back and answer it's working fine.
