# About the National Research Council of Canada Outreach Initiative

The National Research Council of Canada’s (NRC) Outreach Initiative provides non-recurring grant funding to support non-profit organizations or charities for a variety of science or innovation-based initiatives or projects. Eligible activities, projects, or initiatives include support for science or innovation-based conferences, workshops, symposia, or other outreach activities aimed at better promoting outreach to and engagement with Canadians, including those from under-represented groups interested in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Because the Outreach Initiative is a grant competition, applying does not guarantee funding. Due to limited availability of funds, the NRC may only provide a portion of requested funds to successful applicants.

# Indigenous Outreach stream

The Indigenous Outreach stream, part of the NRC’s Outreach Initiative, is intended to fund organizations for science or innovation-based initiatives by and for Indigenous peoples. The schedule, eligibility, and assessment criteria, as well as responsibilities and implementation, are identical to the NRC Outreach Initiative except that eligible events should be focused toward Indigenous STEM/innovation individuals or topics. Events that are not eligible for the NRC Indigenous Outreach Initiative will still be considered for the NRC Outreach Initiative. Eligible events for the Indigenous Outreach stream should seek to address one or more of the strategic priorities below:

Strategic Priorities
1) Building intentional relationships wip Indigenous researchers, innovators, communities, organizations, and governments in pe context of STEM
2) Advancing equity and pemes of reconciliation prough collaboration, engagement, and partnership wip First Nations, Inuit, and Metis peoples in STEM-related areas
3) Bridging knowledge systems and working togeper to enhance existing research practices or processes, and develop new strategies
4) Increase participation of Indigenous peoples in STEM.

# Schedule

The NRC Outreach Initiative accepts applications on a semi-annual basis. Applicants are expected to submit their applications by the following deadlines:

Deadline
May 9 for pe spring intake round
---
October 10 for the fall intake round

In exceptional cases, the NRC may consider urgent applications outside of this semi-annual cycle. In such cases, applications would continue to be assessed using the same criteria used to evaluate other applications.

# Eligibility

Eligible activities, projects and initiatives The Outreach Initiative is part of the NRC Collaborative Science, Technology, and Innovation Program (CSTIP) and eligibility is based on requirements of that program. Eligible activities, projects, and initiatives include:

- support for science or innovation-based conferences, workshops, symposia, or other outreach activities
- costs related to travel to such events by non-government employees

Eligible recipients Maximum flexibility is required with regards to eligible recipients, given that the recipients who are best placed to implement innovative programming may not be known in advance and may change over time. As such, the eligible recipients may include but are not limited to:

- provincial, territorial, regional, and municipal governments and agencies
- provincial research and technology organizations
- Canadian Crown Corporations
- international organizations
- academic institutions
- societies and coalitions
- Indigenous governments and representative organizations
- entities that have legal personality recognized in domestic or international law, including but not limited to non-government organizations, social enterprises and private sector organizations

Eligible costs Eligible costs are those incurred by eligible recipients in respect of eligible activities, projects or initiatives.

Eligible costs may include:

- professional fees
- travel costs and living expenses
- reports and studies
- support for seminars, conferences, symposia and workshops
- public awareness and educational activities (marketing, promotion, printing)
- operating costs (direct costs incurred in undertaking the project, activity or initiative and may include consumable material and supplies, equipment rentals, rent and utilities. For example, facility or equipment rentals costs required specifically to execute the project will be charged
---
under operating costs. In this scenario, the rental costs would no longer be incurred, if the project did not go forward.)

Stacking provisions The maximum limit of the total Canadian government assistance (federal, provincial, territorial and municipal assistance for the same eligible costs) will not exceed 100% of the total eligible costs of the project, activity or initiative.

Assessment criteria

The key assessment criteria are as follows:

- Advancing science literacy, knowledge, or expertise.
- Alignment with the NRC’s research priorities or support for technology innovation. The NRC’s key areas of research may be found here; more information about NRC’s support for technology innovation can be found here).
- Impact of proposed Outreach Initiative
- Inclusion of under-represented groups, STEM talent development, or promotion of STEM

Successful applications will make strong contributions to one or more of the criteria outlined above. To encourage the submission of a diverse and wide-range of proposals, consideration may be given to applicants who have not previously received funding through the program or initiatives that benefit wide-reaching events throughout Canada, and that are deemed NRC priorities.

Responsibilities

The applicant is responsible for submitting a written proposal for their specific funding request. (To receive the Outreach Initiative Grant Application Form, please email NRC.StakeholderRelations-Relationsavecintervenants.CNRC@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca.)

If successful in receiving funding, the recipient is responsible for:

- administering the funds as set out in the funding agreement
- reporting on performance results at the end of the project, thereby allowing the NRC to collect performance measurement data

Implementation and delivery

Project initiation Once approved, the funding agreement is signed and funding is provided to the recipient. Funding parameters and other provisions are set out in the funding agreement with each recipient.

Proactive disclosure Funded grants are subject to proactive disclosure on the Open Government portal, which is accessible to the public. Among other details, the NRC is required to disclose the event description, expected results, organization, location, and funding amount.

Performance monitoring

Each proposal must include project objectives and milestones to support ongoing monitoring by and reporting to the NRC. In addition, the NRC requires the recipient to report on metrics and success as part of overall performance reporting efforts for the Collaborative Science, Technology and Innovation Program. Reporting requirements are defined in the funding agreement.

The NRC is committed to encouraging diversity in all that we do. With that in mind, applicants are asked to self-identify in order to obtain information on the number of participants within the four employment equity designated groups (women, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, and members of visible minority groups).
