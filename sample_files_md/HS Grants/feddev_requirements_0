# Technology

Projects in cutting-edge sectors (e.g., artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, medical technologies, digital health and agri-tech).

# Industrial transition

Projects that support change in traditional sectors to adopt new technologies and other innovations to improve their competitiveness and build new opportunities (e.g., the adoption of automation in manufacturing to increase efficiency and productivity).

Priority may be given to projects that support the transition to zero-emission vehicles and housing manufacturing innovation.

Inclusive growth and regional coverage are cross-cutting investment principles. FedDev Ontario wants to help you grow your business. We welcome projects that create new opportunities for underrepresented groups and promote growth across urban centres and small and rural communities alike.

# How funding works

An application does not constitute a commitment from FedDev Ontario for financial assistance. If an application for project funding receives approval, you will be expected to sign a legally binding contribution agreement before funding can be provided.

# Matching Requirement (Cost Sharing)

|Matching Requirement|Eligible project costs are shared between you and FedDev Ontario.|
|---|---|
|Cost Sharing|- Normally, the maximum rate of support from FedDev Ontario is 50% of eligible project costs. FedDev Ontario funding is not intended to replace available commercial financing or other sources of funding. Preference will be given to projects that maximize funding from other sources (i.e., where FedDev Ontario's contribution is less than 50%).
- Your sources of funding (i.e., 50% or more of eligible project costs) can consist of cash contributions from your own business and other partners (e.g., private sector lenders, other government funding).

# Ineligible Costs

---
Project timeframes may vary with activities and costs proposed to begin after the application intake closes on June 24, 2024. Any costs incurred before this date are at the applicant's own risk if the project is approved. Projects, activities, and budgets can span multiple fiscal years, typically lasting between 1-3 years.

Repayment terms are interest-free and unconditionally repayable as per the key funding conditions. Repayment usually starts one year after project completion, with the payment schedule outlined in the contribution agreement.
